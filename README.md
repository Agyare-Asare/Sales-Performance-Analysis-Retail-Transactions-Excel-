## The Story Behind the Analysis
This project started with a simple question: who is really driving sales in this retail business?
Using transaction-level data, I wanted to move beyond totals and understand how customer behavior, product choices, and time all come together to influence revenue.

## The Data
The dataset captures individual retail transactions, including when purchases happened, what was bought, and basic customer demographics such as age and gender. Each transaction includes a Total Amount, which represents the actual revenue generated and is used throughout the analysis.
## How I Approached the Problem
I first cleaned and structured the data in Excel, making sure dates, amounts, and customer attributes were consistent and usable. From there, I explored sales trends over time and broke revenue down by product category and customer segments to see where the business was truly performing well.
What the Data Revealed
## A few clear patterns stood out:
Sales fluctuate over time, pointing to periods of higher and lower demand rather than steady performance. Revenue is concentrated in a small number of product categories, suggesting that not all products contribute equally to overall performance.
Customers aged 46–55 generate the highest total sales, making them the most valuable age group in this dataset.
Looking at revenue rather than transaction counts provided a more accurate picture of customer value across genders.
## Why This Matters
These findings show that revenue growth is less about chasing volume and more about understanding who spends the most and what they buy. Without this breakdown, key customer groups and high-performing products could easily be overlooked.
## What Could Be Done Next
Develop targeted campaigns and loyalty offers for customers aged 46–55.
Focus inventory planning and promotions around the top revenue-generating product categories.
Use sales trends to better time promotions and manage stock during peak periods.
## Tools Used
